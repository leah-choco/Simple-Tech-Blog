# Simple-Tech-Blog
Deployed Link: https://pacific-gorge-59791.herokuapp.com/

## Goals of this Project:
The goal was to use MVC (models, views, controllers) file structure to build a full-stack app. This app has the capability to have the user sign up or log-in. Then they can write blog posts, edit and delete posts as well. There is also the capability to write comments on other people's blog posts. 

## Installation
Packages needed: bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv,express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, and sequelize

## What I Learned:
This was my first time developing a full-stack application from scratch. It was an incredible challenge to take on by myself. Overall, writing routes and getting everything connected was so intense. It's clear to me also that I don't enjoy front-end design as much as I love working with models/controllers.
